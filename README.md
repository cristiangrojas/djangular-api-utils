# djangular-api-utils
A set of API utils to be used in Django (with django-rest-framework) &amp; Angular.js applications.

This project is currently being used only by me in most of my Django projects which includes Angular.js
and django-rest-framework implementations. I will may think of making it more readable for others
to be able to include in their own projects.
